How To Build
-------------------------------------------------
Open up terminal and change directory to the location
of 'dictionary.cpp' (make sure all included files
are also located there). Enter the command 'make main' to
compile and build the executable. Proceed to run
the executable, or type './main < file.dat' in
terminal, where 'file.dat' is the file you wish to
read.
*************************************************
How to use
-------------------------------------------------

As it stands now, there are too many pointer errors
for the program to work and I ran out of time and
patience to finish fixing them. I do apologize for
not completing the program.

**************************************************
How to remove
--------------------------------------------------
In terminal go to the directory that 'main'
is located. Type 'make clean' to remove all but
source files.
